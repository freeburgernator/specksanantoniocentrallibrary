            <p> Libraries are a means for society to distribute information.

          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p> To this end, the San Antonio Central Library has created a number of learning spaces. These spaces revolve around a central six-story atrium to draw guests in, but maintain their orientation in the otherwise confusing building.<sup>1</sup> Areas include:<sup>2</sup>

            <p class="subtitle"> By Turner Drexel </p>
            <p>
              The San Antonio Central Library (referred to in this source as the “New San Antonio Main Library”) was located on the site of an abandoned Sears, which constructed the parking lot still in use today, on an odd irregular pentagon. Legorreta’s design was chosen primarily because it complied to the vision of the library and the reality of the cite, while being novel, inviting, and modern. The location and design were not without critique however, some believing that the structure should go further downtown or respect the local architecture more.

            <p class="subtitle"> By Craig Sapatos, edited by Terry Webb </p>
            <p>
              The Central Library, named so during construction to distinguish it from the old “Main Library,” was commissioned in response to a recognized need to expand the services of the library. Librarians maintained a major influence on the design of the building throughout its construction and interior design, including raising an additional $10 million to buy new furniture for the building. Of chief and continual concern was lowering maintenance costs, completing the project on time, and creating a flexible space for additional renovations. The library was a huge success, gathering over 10,000 visitors and 600 new library cardholders in its first week, and increasing daily visitors from 800 to 3,000.

            <p>
              The building was certainly the focus of controversy. Legorreta painted the structure red because he thought it was “joyful.” Colorful characters disagreed, naming the color “don’t-look-at-it-with-a-hangover-red.” and “bleeding heart liberal red.” These criticisms bay betray a more dangerous anti-Mexican sentiment concerned about the loss of Anglo-heritage in the white-minority Texas city. Legorreta himself settled upon the nomenclature “enchilada red.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The color was chosen only after construction had already started, and celebrated the openning of the building with a “paint the town red” celebration. The paint itself is high maintenance, probably requiring a recoating every seven years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, the building was a huge success, increasing book circulation by 95%, and receiving positive reviews from locals.

        <h1> Typical of Legorreta </h1>
        <h5> The Architect </h5>
        <p>
          Ricardo Legorreta was a prolific Mexican architect. Trained at the National University of Mexico, his signature style was a mix of Mexico’s indigenous and colonial sensibilities with modern simplicity.<sup>1</sup> A dear friend of Luis Barragan, Legorreta employed the same simple and auter base of simple shapes to maximize the emotional connection of the structure, but then added bright color and dynamic lighting capacity back into the architecture.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Legorreta was entirely an emotional designer, believing structured design would gut the structure of the necessary character.<sup>1</sup> He would not draft until he had already arrived at the shape of the structure.<sup>1</sup> Elements and colors would be added simply because he felt it was necessary.<sup>2</sup> Details would be added by later drafters after the shape had already been established.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Legorreta received the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 2000 and the Praemium Imperiale arts prize of Japan in 2011.<sup>3</sup> He passed away on December 30, 2011 at the age of 80.<sup>3</sup> His firm, Legorreta + Legorreta, is continued by his son Victor, who continues to expound on the styles of his father in modern settings.<sup>3</sup>

            <p> The San Antonio Central Library is located in an urban setting, but not too close to the other towers of downtown San Antonio and the river walk. The intersection is indeed awkward, and the parallelogram shape of the building fits well with the streets, aligning each side to some street.
            </p>
            <p> As noticeable as other features, the building is simply different than its surrounding parks, hospitals, schools, parking lots, and other buildings, in terms of color and shape. In this sense, it attempts to impose its own vision on the area, rather than conform to the dominant style. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the beholder. </p>
            <p> It is certainly an imposing structure. They even colored the sidewalks. </p>

                  The structures uses lines and light to create dynamic systems in the building. The manipulation of the light and the repeating structures create these hypnotic images decorated with gradients of colors, which create complexity in the relatively simple design, materials, and construction.

                  The chief issue is that the building does not appear to work with nature. The bright red color, still luminous after years of fading, the perfectly straight lines,  the perfect spheres: nature provides no close analogs on earth. The building seems like a plastic juxtaposition to the trees in the foreground.

                  The issues with this modernist approach and drive for maximum space efficiency is a total loss of scale. I posit that the birds and the person appear to be about the same height in comparison to the building.

                  Water seems like an odd inclusion. Water is literally turbulent - chaotic, indeterminant, and inherently organic. This seems at odd with the rest of the structure, and especially in these features, it seems as though the structures canals are attempting to enforce upon the water its rules, while the water does what it wants.

        <h1> Derided by Some </h1>
        <h5>Blog Post</h5>
        <p> The “Project for Public Spaces” hosts a database of case studies called the “Hall of Shame Archive,” which documents complaints against local public spaces. One of these was logged against the San Antonio Public Library.</p>
        <p> The post, which can be read in full here, brings to light two implications: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The building is hostile to those who approach by bus or pedestrians, as there is a single main entrance.</li>
          <li>The structures distinctive style separates it from the rest of San Antonio. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The authors points about logistics difficulties are well taken. The building is very much oriented toward its parking lot, and seems to disregard the long road along the north side. However, the buses likely have to stop in this inconvenient location because of the realities of the road.</p>
        <p> The distinction of the building certainly does abruptly separate it from the rest of downtown, and perhaps purposefully so. The architecture is inherently Mexican, unlike the southwestern blend that is usual in the rest of San Antonio. Whether this is representative of changing times or disrespectful of location is an opinion probably driven by debates of identity.</p>
        <p> Overall, I can understand the concerns of this author, but disagree with the severity. Cosmopolitan cities are a collection of odd-balls, not uniformities.</p>

        <h1> But a Success to Many. </h1>
        <h5> Summary </h5>
        <p> The San Antonio Central Library was a bold move by the city, which brought a visually eccentric building to the downtown image. The building gathered controversy for its outward appearance, but succeeded in almost every demanded capacity. It not only increased readership, but created new spaces for students of all ages to learn. The building has become an icon not just of books, but of learning and adaptation to changing times.</p>
        <p> These are certainly important qualities. Libraries are in many places a dying public space., yet projects such as this one, and the much newer Austin Central Library defy the trend. </p>
        <p> Perhaps the need for libraries is best summarized by Annie Spence, a Detroit Librarian, speaking to this American Life:</p>

          <p> “I always say that it's the only place-- well, it's one of the last places you can go that you don't have to buy or believe in anything to come in. You can just come, and we'll help you, no matter what your question is. We'll try to figure it out with you.” </p>
